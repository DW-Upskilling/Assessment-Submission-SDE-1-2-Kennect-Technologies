Underlying Business Challenges:
- Inefficient distribution of daily reminders to all users, without taking into account their level of engagement
- The need for replacing email-based communication with chatbots
- Relying on emails to gather input from users

User Limitation:

The daily reminder system can be optimized by limiting the recipients to only active users
This can be achieved by considering the users' last voting activity
If a user hasn't voted in recent weeks, suspension of sending daily reminders via email can be considered
Chatbots Adoption:

The current email delivery services are resource-intensive
The integration of chatbots can bring a more interactive and lightweight solution to the communication process
Chatbots are known for their low resource utilization and engaging conversations.
